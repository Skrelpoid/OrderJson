Oops, it seems like the directory you are trying to sort is not supported by Java/LibGdx. To fix this, create a new folder elsewhere, e.g. on your Desktop , name it SupportFix and then copy the content of the unsupported folder into it. Finally copy this program into it and run it. (Do not put this Program directly into your Desktop folder! Instead, copy it into a folder on your Desktop). If the problem persists, please open an issue on GitHub or message Skrelpoid directly.
