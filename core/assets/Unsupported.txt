Oops, it seems like the directory you are trying to sort is not supported by Java/LibGdx. To fix this, create a new folder elsewhere, e.g. your Desktop, name it SupportFix and then copy the content of the unsupported folder into it. Finally copy this program into it and run it. If the problem persists, please open an issue on GitHub or message Skrelpoid directly.
